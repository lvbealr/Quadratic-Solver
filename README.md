## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This programm was created at DED's Summer School 2024 to solve different quadratic equations.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Clone Repository

What things you need to clone the repository to your own computer.

```
git clone github.com/lvbealr/SumSchoolForLinux
```

### Build and Using

You can use <b>MAKE</b> to build the program and run it.

Enter the following command in the terminal:

```
make
```

Once compiled you can run the executable with the following command and use different flags.

```
./main
```

The program will start in manual mode and ask you to enter data for correct operation.

## üîß MODES <a name = "modes"></a>

The program provides several operating modes.

### MANUAL MODE

In manual mode, the program will ask you to enter the coefficients of the quadratic equation with the following message:

```
./main -> Input values of coefficients a, b, c: ### your input
```

### TEST MODE

In test mode, the program will perform tests, the data for which is specified in a file called testData.h. For using this mode you should enter following command in console.

```
./main --test ### running tests
```

### GOOGLE TEST MODE

Google tests mode involves checking the program with test data from the testData.h file using Google C++ Testing Framework

```
./main --gtest ### running google tests
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

The program can be useful to a wide range of users. School Students can solve quadratic equations in their homework, and students can use the program as an aid in higher mathematics problems.
